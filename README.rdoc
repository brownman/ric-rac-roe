= Ric-Rac-Roe

Ric-Rac-Roe is the classic tic-tac-toe game with a choice of 3 interfaces:
- command line interface (cli)
- web app (via Sinatra)
- GUI (via Shoes)

The motivation behind this project was to experiment with a few technologies: Sinatra, Shoes, HAML. In addition to that, an effort has been made to write concise Ruby code.
